# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
    - I definitely do need more practice, but I am getting the hang of using the `each` method.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    - I definitely spent a TON of time on this work and the unproductive struggle definitely kicked in. It was stressful and I feel very tired. Once my research strategies and approach began to improve, overcoming the challenges in the iterations lesson was so exciting.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - I definitely have to wrap my head around methods and how Array methods affect order, and how those outputs can be properly utilized. I should'nt need to adjust my calendar very much, I'll just need to keep practicing effective research strategies and becoming more efficient with my approach.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - As stated earlier I just generally need to establish more clarity on the topic of array methods and logical operators (especially the two working in tandem). I hope to continue working towards creating enough time to continue researching and practicing intermittently between upcoming sections.
